    <h3><b>Hi, I am Samuel B. Martins (Samuka), Ph.D.</b></h3>    

    <p>I am an assistant professor, data scientist, researcher, and YouTube creator. I am an enthusiast about machine learning and data science to improve decision-making. I have a solid theoretical background and practical experience developing ML solutions for many areas, especially (medical) image applications. My recent projects focus on designing ML/DL models for (medical) image analysis in different contexts – such as automatic detection of brain anomalies – and applying visual analytics techniques to understand how these models work.</p>

    <p>My YouTube channel, <a href="https://youtube.com/xavecoding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">xavecoding</a>, is dedicated to producing courses and tutorials on ML and computer science (programming, data structures, web development, ...). <i>The channel is aimed at Portuguese speakers.</i></p>

    My <b>research interests</b> are:
    <ul>
        <li>machine learning</li>
        <li>deep learning</li>
        <li>medical image applications</li>
        <li>computational vision</li>
        <li>visual analytics</li>
        <li>explainable artifical intelligence</li>
    </ul>
