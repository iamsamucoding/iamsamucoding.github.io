  abstract: 'Automatic detection of brain anomalies in MR images is challenging and complex due to intensity similarity between lesions and healthy tissues as well as the large variability in shape, size, and location among different anomalies. Even though discriminative models (supervised learning) are commonly used for this task, they require quite high-quality annotated training images, which are absent for most medical image analysis problems. Inspired by groupwise shape analysis, we adapt a recent fully unsupervised supervoxel-based approach (SAAD)—designed for abnormal asymmetry detection of the hemispheres—to detect brain anomalies from registration errors. Our method, called BADRESC, extracts supervoxels inside the right and left hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem, models registration errors for each supervoxel, and treats outliers as anomalies. Experimental results on MR-T1 brain images of stroke patients show that BADRESC outperforms a convolutional-autoencoder-based method and attains similar detection rates for hemispheric lesions in comparison to SAAD with substantially fewer false positives. It also presents promising detection scores for lesions in the cerebellum and brainstem.'

  abstract: 'Several brain disorders are associated with abnormal brain asymmetries (asymmetric anomalies). Several computer-based methods aim to detect such anomalies automatically. Recent advances in this area use automatic unsupervised techniques that extract pairs of symmetric supervoxels in the hemispheres, model normal brain asymmetries for each pair from healthy subjects, and treat outliers as anomalies. Yet, there is no deep understanding of the impact of the supervoxel segmentation quality for abnormal asymmetry detection, especially for small anomalies, nor of the added value of using a specialized model for each supervoxel pair instead of a single global appearance model. We aim to answer these questions by a detailed evaluation of different scenarios for supervoxel segmentation and classification for detecting abnormal brain asymmetries. Experimental results on 3D MR-T1 brain images of stroke patients confirm the importance of high-quality supervoxels fit anomalies and the use of a specific classifier for each supervoxel. Next, we present a refinement of the detection method that reduces the number of false-positive supervoxels, thereby making the detection method easier to use for visual inspection and analysis of the found anomalies.'

  abstract: '<b>Purpose:</b> Automated segmentation of brain structures (objects) in MR three-dimensional (3D) images for quantitative analysis has been a challenge and probabilistic atlases (PAs) are among the most well-succeeded approaches. However, the existing models do not adapt to possible object anomalies due to the presence of a disease or a surgical procedure. Post-processing operation does not solve the problem, for example, tissue classification to detect and remove such anomalies inside the resulting segmentation mask, because segmentation errors on healthy tissues cannot be fixed. Such anomalies very often alter the shape and texture of the brain structures, making them different from the appearance of the model. In this paper, we present an effective and efficient adaptive probabilistic atlas, named AdaPro, to circumvent the problem and evaluate it on a challenging task - the segmentation of the left hemisphere, right hemisphere, and cerebellum, without pons and medulla, in 3D MR-T1 brain images of Epilepsy patients. This task is challenging due to temporal lobe resections, artifacts, and the absence of contrast in some parts between the structures of interest.<br/><br/><b>Methods:</b> In AdaPro, we first build one probabilistic atlas per object of interest from a training set with normal 3D images and the corresponding 3D object masks. Second, we incorporate a texture classifier based on convex optimization which dynamically indicates the regions of the target 3D image where the PAs (shape constraints) should be further adapted. This strategy is mathematically more elegant and avoids problems with post-processing. Third, we add a new object-based delineation algorithm based on combinatorial optimization and diffusion filtering. AdaPro can then be used to locate and delineate the objects in the coordinate space of the atlas or of the test image. We also compare AdaPro with three other state-of-the-art methods: an statistical shape model based on synergistic object search and delineation, and two methods based on multi-atlas label fusion (MALF).<br/><br/><b>Results:</b> We evaluate the methods quantitatively on 3D MR-T1 brain images of 2T and 3T from epilepsy patients, before and after temporal lobe resections, and on the template and native coordinate spaces. The results show that AdaPro is considerably faster and consistently more accurate than the baselines with statistical significance in both coordinate spaces.<br/><br/><b>Conclusion:</b> AdaPro can be used as a fast and effective step for brain tissue segmentation and it can also be easily extended to segment subcortical brain structures. By choice of its components, probabilistic atlas, texture classifier, and delineation algorithm, it can also be extended to other organs and imaging modalities.'

  abstract: '<b>Purpose:</b> The automated segmentation of each lung and trachea in CT scans is commonly taken as a solved problem. Indeed, existing approaches may easily fail in the presence of some abnormalities caused by a disease, trauma, or previous surgery. For robustness, we present ALTIS (implementation is available at http://lids.ic.unicamp.br/downloads) - a fast automatic lung and trachea CT-image segmentation method that relies on image features and relative shape- and intensity-based characteristics less affected by most appearance variations of abnormal lungs and trachea.<br/><br/><b>Methods:</b> ALTIS consists of a sequence of image foresting transforms (IFTs) organized in three main steps: (a) lung-and-trachea extraction, (b) seed estimation inside background, trachea, left lung, and right lung, and (c) their delineation such that each object is defined by an optimum-path forest rooted at its internal seeds. We compare ALTIS with two methods based on shape models (SOSM-S and MALF), and one algorithm based on seeded region growing (PTK).<br/><br/><b>Results:</b> The experiments involve the highest number of scans found in literature - 1255 scans, from multiple public data sets containing many anomalous cases, being only 50 normal scans used for training and 1205 scans used for testing the methods. Quantitative experiments are based on two metrics, DICE and ASSD. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the robustness of ALTIS in seed estimation. Considering the test set, the proposed method achieves an average DICE of 0.987 for both lungs and 0.898 for the trachea, whereas an average ASSD of 0.938 for the right lung, 0.856 for the left lung, and 1.316 for the trachea. These results indicate that ALTIS is statistically more accurate and considerably faster than the compared methods, being able to complete segmentation in a few seconds on modern PCs.<br/><br/><b>Conclusion:</b> ALTIS is the most effective and efficient choice among the compared methods to segment left lung, right lung, and trachea in anomalous CT scans for subsequent detection, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of abnormal structures in the lung parenchyma and pleural space.'

  abstract: 'Consider a face image data set from clients of a company and the problem of building a face recognition system from it. Video cameras can be used to acquire several images per client in order to maximize the robustness of the system. However, as the data set grows huge, the accuracy of the system might be seriously compromised since the number of negative samples for each user is increasing. We propose here a first solution for this problem, which (i) limits the number of negative samples in the training set for preserving responsiveness during user enrollment, (ii) selects the most informative negative samples with respect to each user for preserving accuracy, and (iii) builds a user-specific classification model. We combine a high-dimensional data representation from deep learning with a method that selects negative samples from a large mining set and builds, within interactive times, effective user-specific training set and classifier, using linear support vector machines. The method can also be used with other feature extractors. It has shown superior performance as compared to five baseline methods on three unconstrained data sets.'
